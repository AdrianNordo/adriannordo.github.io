The series is set on the fictional continents of <strong>Westeros & Essos</strong>, Game of Thrones has a large cast and follows several story arcs. One is about the <strong> Throne of Westeros</strong> and follows a web of
alliances and conflicts among the noble dynasties, either wanting to claim the throne for themselves or fighting for independence from it. Another focuses of the last descendant of the realm's deposed ruling dynasty (<strong>House Targaryen</strong>) who has been exiled to Essos and is plotting a return
to the throne. The last story arc follows A bastard and his journey in the <strong>Night's Watch</strong>, a brotherhood defending the realm against the white walkers, but not people in Westeros believe they exist.
