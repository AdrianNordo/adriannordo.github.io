    In Westeros it is accustomed to have a family name and sigil, the family name and sigil is something 
    to be proud of. The Targaryen sigil is a three-headed dragon breathing flames, red on black. The

    as House Targaryen of King's Landing.<br><br> House targaryen is the only family of dragonlords who survived the 
    Doom of Valyria, the Targaryens left Valyria about twelve years before the Doom. They resided for multiple generations
    on the island of <strong>Dragonstone</strong>, until <strong>Aegon The Conqueror</strong> and his sisters (who were also his wifes), <strong>Visenya</strong> and <strong>Rhaenys</strong>,
    began the first of the Wars of Conquest in  2 BC "Before the Conquest" <br><br>
    During Aegon's Conquest, the Targaryens build the Aegonfort in the new capital <strong>King's Landing</strong>, but the Aegonfort didnt last long
    and was later torn down and the <strong>Red Keep</strong> Was built.
